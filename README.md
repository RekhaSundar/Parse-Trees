# Parse-Trees
Python 3

In the program 2 sets of grammars are described and 2 sentences, one for each of the grammar set is created. The program is written to generate the related Parse Trees using NLTKâ€™s Recursive Descent Parser (top-down method parser). The python script loads the parser with one of the 2 grammar sets at a time and generates a parse tree for the sentence created for that set. The tree can be seen in the output console and the visulaisation is as shown below.
